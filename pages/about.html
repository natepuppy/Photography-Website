  <center><p class="about">Hello friend! Thank you for coming to my website! I enjoy being able to share these photos with so many people!  I am a mother of this wonderful little boy you see in the picture above and wife to the loving man standing next to me and I couldn't love them more! I am from Elk Grove, California and that's where my story began, but it continues here in the white mountains of Arizona where we moved in May of 2016. I've always had a passion for what I could do when I got behind the lens of a camera and so I put my passion to work by doing photo sessions for friends & family. It brought be so much joy to see the happiness and beauty of those moments captured to cherish forever and I realized I wanted to really do this. I have had plenty of years experimenting and turned to some incredible sources of knowledge to put toward my photos and the results so far are what you see here on my website, I do everything ranging from weddings, to family's, babies, engagements, bridals, senior, missionary and much more. I would love to help you in your photo needs and together we can capture those moments that will last you a lifetime!</p></center>
